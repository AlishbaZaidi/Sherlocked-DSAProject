# Sherlocked-DSAProject

In order to run our program, there are a few prerequisites that must be met. Firstly, you will need to install Git on your laptop. This can be done by visiting the Git website and following the installation instructions.
Additionally, you will need to install an ADB (Android Debug Bridge) driver. This driver allows your laptop to communicate with your locked smartphone via USB debugging. You can find instructions for installing the ADB driver on the Android Developer website.
Once you have installed Git and the ADB driver, you can download our program files. Save the treesdsaproject file as treesdsaproject.py and make sure to change the path in the text file of DSAprojectfinal. Then, save that file in .sh format to run the program.
To run the program, simply open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the program files are saved. Then, enter the command "./DSAprojectfinal.sh" to run the program. The program will prompt you to connect your locked smartphone to your laptop via USB debugging and guide you through the process of unlocking your phone.
